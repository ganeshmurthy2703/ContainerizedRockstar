            Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk,<br>
            I'm a woman's man: no time to talk.<br>
            Music loud and women warm,<br>
            I've been kicked around since I was born.<br>
            <br>
            And now it's all right. It's OK.<br>
            And you may look the other way.<br>
            We can try to understand<br>
            The New York Times' effect on man.<br>
            <br>
            Whether you're a brother<br>
            Or whether you're a mother,<br>
            You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.<br>
            Feel the city breakin'<br>
            And everybody shakin',<br>
            And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.<br>
            Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.<br>
            Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive.<br>
            <br>
            Well, now, I get low and I get high,<br>
            And if I can't get either, I really try.<br>
            Got the wings of heaven on my shoes.<br>
            I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose.<br>
            <br>
            You know it's all right. It's OK.<br>
            I'll live to see another day.<br>
