<div class="text-center">
        I'm sitting here in a boring room<br>
        It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon<br>
        I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do<br>
        I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you<br>
        But nothing ever happens and I wonder<br>
        <br>
        I'm driving around in my car<br>
        I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far<br>
        I'd like to change my point of view<br>
        I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you<br>
        But nothing ever happens and I wonder<br>
        <br>
        I wonder how, I wonder why<br>
        Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky<br>
        And all that I can see<br>
        Is just a yellow lemon tree<br>
        <br>
        I'm turning my head up and down<br>
        I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around<br>
        And all that I can see is just another lemon tree<br>
        <br>
        Sing: dah<br>
        Da da da da da - di da dah<br>
        Da da da da da - di dah dah<br>
        Da di di di dah<br>
        <br>
        I'm sitting here, I miss the power<br>
        I'd like to go out, taking a shower<br>
        But there's a heavy cloud inside my head<br>
        I feel so tired, put myself into bed<br>
        Well nothing ever happens and I wonder<br>
        <br>
        Isolation is not good for me<br>
        Isolation<br>
        I don't want to sit on a lemon tree<br>
        <br>
        I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy<br>
        Baby, anyhow I'll get another toy<br>
        And everything will happen and you'll wonder<br>
        <br>
        I wonder how, I wonder why<br>
        Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky<br>
        And all that I can see is just another lemon tree<br>
        I'm turning my head up and down<br>
        I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around<br>
        And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree<br>
        <br>
        And I wonder, wonder<br>
        <br>
        I wonder how, I wonder why<br>
        Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky<br>
        And all that I can see<br>
        And all that I can see<br>
        And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
